# RnS-Debug-Set
Set of loot that assists with debugging in Rabbit and Steel Modding API Development

For it_atk_pat_sampler, you can toggle attack patterns against allies/foes by switching the hidden vars0 set in onSquarePickup. In the Items.ini file you can also respectively set the str_mult to 0 so that way you don't get damaged-noises/visuals, and set the hbsType to a buff
